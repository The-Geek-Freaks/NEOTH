# NEOTH 1.0 build and release cadence

This contract keeps the Road-to-Gold build wave fast without weakening the
evidence required for the public `v1.0.0` tag.

## Evidence ladder

NEOTH tests every shipped capability and every advertised platform contract,
not the Cartesian product of every provider, channel, architecture and Linux
distribution. A source change invalidates only the evidence that depends on
that source. The next broader gate runs once after the affected source set is
frozen.

| Boundary | Required evidence | Deliberately deferred |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Edit loop | File-scoped formatter/parser checks and the smallest affected unit or contract filter | Workspace linking, installers and cross-OS jobs |
| Bounded commit | Affected-crate `cargo check`, focused behavior regressions, static wiring/packaging contracts and independent review | Release profile and distro matrix |
| Source-frozen package/GUI wave | Strict Clippy and complete tests for the affected crates/features; GUI test binary linked once | Native installer matrix |
| Workstream/protocol milestone | Full Linux workspace plus only the affected native OS/feature/transport jobs | Public artifacts |
| Weekly/manual milestone | Complete three-OS CI; Security/CodeQL when authority, dependency, unsafe or release boundaries changed | Tag/release publication |
| Unchanged release candidate | Full CI, Security and CodeQL on one exact SHA | Any further source edits |
| Tagged artifact set | Build every release target once; package and test only those downloaded bytes | Any compile inside a clean-machine smoke job |

`source-frozen` means that no file contributing to a package, protocol,
generated asset or embedded release identity changes after its consolidated
gate begins. A later documentation-only edit does not invalidate an unrelated
binary result; a later source, build-script, lockfile, packaging or embedded
knowledge change does.

## During feature and wiring work

Every pull request targeting `main` and every push to `main` runs
`.github/workflows/preflight.yml`:

- locked Cargo metadata without dependency compilation;
- workspace formatting;
- offline packaging, release, provider-parity, and lost-feature contracts;
- checked-in shell syntax.

The PR/push preflight must not compile, link, or execute the Rust workspace. Each
bounded implementation slice still receives targeted local/static verification
and an independent code review before commit.

The complete `.github/workflows/ci.yml` matrix runs:

- for pull requests;
- once per week to expose accumulated integration drift;
- on explicit milestone or release-candidate dispatch.

The complete `.github/workflows/security.yml` matrix runs:

- once per week;
- on explicit release-candidate dispatch.

It intentionally does not run with repository security-state permissions in a
pull-request-controlled context. Pull requests receive the full read-only CI
matrix; the privileged SARIF upload and repository-wide CodeQL alert gate stay
on the trusted weekly/manual Security path.

An interface, protocol, schema, packaging, dependency, unsafe-code, or
cross-process authority change is a milestone and may justify an immediate
manual full run. A documentation-only or isolated static-contract commit does
not.

## Final Gold verification

After every mandatory checkbox in `PLAN/ROAD_TO_1_0_GOLD.md` is complete, freeze
one release-candidate commit. Do not rebuild from a different commit between
these gates:

1. Dispatch full CI on the exact candidate SHA.
2. Dispatch Security and CodeQL on the same SHA.
3. Require both runs to be fresh and successful.
4. Create the release tag on that unchanged SHA.
5. Build each target artifact once in `release.yml`.
6. Package installers from those downloaded artifacts.
7. Run clean-machine install, launch, upgrade, rollback, and uninstall probes
   against those same artifacts.
8. Publish only if every required platform and capability receipt belongs to
   the tagged artifact set.

`release.yml` remains fail-closed: a fast Preflight result can never substitute
for the fresh exact-head CI and Security evidence.

## Required final platform coverage

The following is the acceptance matrix that must exist before Gold, not a claim
that the current open R4-01 workflow already proves it. NEOTH must test every
promised support class, not every Linux distribution with the same test suite.

- The final matrix must run the full Rust workspace tests once per
  operating-system semantics class:
  Windows, macOS, and Linux. Feature/transport matrices add only the relevant
  compile or focused behavioral probes.
- Architecture-specific builds and clean-machine journeys must prove Windows x64
  and ARM64, macOS Intel and Apple Silicon, Linux GNU x64 and ARM64, plus the
  headless musl contract without rerunning the whole workspace suite.
- Debian/Ubuntu clean machines must test the DEB transaction and desktop
  runtime.
- Fedora/RHEL-family clean machines must test the RPM transaction and desktop
  runtime.
- A glibc-floor machine must test the portable GNU archive.
- Alpine must test the headless musl archive.
- Windows and macOS clean machines must test their native signed installer,
  first-run GUI/CLI choice, surface switching, start-menu/application launch,
  upgrade, rollback, and uninstall.

Those future distro jobs must consume the already-built artifact. They must not
rebuild NEOTH or repeat the entire workspace test suite. Additional
distributions will either be covered by the documented portable fallback or
will not be advertised until a clean-machine receipt exists.

## Closed acceptance receipts

Every final artifact smoke job must emit one machine-verifiable JSON receipt
containing the schema version, tag, commit SHA, artifact and installer
SHA-256, platform/architecture/ABI or package class, previous/current version,
executed journey IDs, code/self-knowledge identity, start/end state, result and
timestamp. The release DAG must reject missing, duplicate, unknown or
digest-mismatched receipts before signing or publication.

The required receipt set includes:

- portable GNU on the documented oldest supported glibc class;
- headless musl inside pinned Alpine rather than only on an Ubuntu host;
- DEB through `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu semantics;
- RPM through `dnf` on Fedora/RHEL semantics;
- Windows x64/ARM64 native installer, first-run/surface switching, real
  `N -> N+1`, rollback and uninstall;
- macOS Intel/Apple Silicon signed/notarized package, first-run/surface
  switching, real `N -> N+1`, rollback and uninstall.

The artifact producer, installer packager and smoke runner may be separate
jobs, but the receipt must bind them to the same immutable bytes. A same-version
reinstall is useful idempotency evidence and is not accepted as an upgrade or
rollback proof.
